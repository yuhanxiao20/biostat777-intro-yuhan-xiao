It could potentially be explained by the higher male birth rates and a more diverse pool of girl baby names. With the exception of Emily, most names experienced a decline in popularity during this time period. Over time, new names have become more favored by parents and replaced old popular names after a few years. To some extent, popular baby names might capture the then-current popular culture and celebrity influence."
